### **README: FreeRTOS-Based Sensor Monitoring System**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **FreeRTOS-based sensor monitoring system** for environmental and light measurements. It utilizes an LCD for displaying real-time data, a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, and a photoresistor for light intensity measurement. Alarms are triggered when thresholds are exceeded. Tasks are scheduled using FreeRTOS, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

## **Features**

- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**:
  - Reads data from a DHT22 sensor.
  - Displays real-time temperature and humidity values on the LCD.
  
- **Light Intensity Monitoring**:
  - Reads data from a photoresistor.
  - Displays light intensity on the LCD.

- **Threshold Monitoring**:
  - Compares readings against predefined thresholds.
  - Activates an alarm if values exceed the thresholds.

- **Multitasking with FreeRTOS**:
  - Separate tasks for data reading, threshold monitoring, and display updates.
  - Ensures smooth, non-blocking operation.

## **Hardware Requirements**

1. **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno or compatible board.
2. **Sensors**:
   - DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor).
   - Photoresistor (for light intensity measurement).
3. **LCD**: 16x2 LCD with I2C interface.
4. **Alarm**: LED or buzzer connected to a digital pin.
5. **Other Components**:
   - Resistors for photoresistor and pull-ups.
   - Breadboard and jumper wires.

## **Software Requirements**

1. **Arduino IDE**: Version 1.8 or later.
2. **Libraries**:
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`: For LCD communication.
   - `DHT22`: For interfacing with the DHT22 sensor.
   - `Arduino_FreeRTOS`: For implementing FreeRTOS.
3. **FreeRTOS**:
   - Used for task scheduling and inter-task communication.

## **System Design**

### **Tasks and Responsibilities**
1. **Display Task**:
   - Updates the LCD with temperature, humidity, light intensity, and a counter.
   - Runs every 2 seconds.

2. **Read Light Task**:
   - Reads light intensity from the photoresistor.
   - Updates shared `sensorData` structure.
   - Runs every 100 milliseconds.

3. **Monitor Thresholds Task**:
   - Monitors light, temperature, and humidity against thresholds.
   - Activates alarm if thresholds are exceeded.
   - Runs every 500 milliseconds.

4. **Read Environment Task**:
   - Reads temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor.
   - Updates shared `sensorData` structure.
   - Runs every 2 seconds.

### **Synchronization**
- **Mutex**: Used to synchronize access to the shared `sensorData` structure, preventing race conditions.
